# oauth2-cli

This is a simple command line utility to perform a 3-legged OAuth 2.0 flow
for APIs such as [Strava][] where you authorize an application write access
to your data on your behalf.

[Strava]: http://strava.github.io/api/partner/v3/oauth/

It will give you an access token that you can use with your own CLI
application without needing to host it on the web.
